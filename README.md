## Description

The first idea for our project would be a distributed database. This database
will distributed file and keep them available at all time (or close to). The initial
objective would be to make it run, being able to store files and access it, then to
update it without conflict. If we’re still running, we could enable better option, like
same time same file modification possibility, or build an other system using our db.
